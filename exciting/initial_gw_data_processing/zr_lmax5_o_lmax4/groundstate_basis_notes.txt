Andris has suggested that the trial energy parameter for high-l value los, at least in the groundstate,
should 0.0-0.15. Generally-speaking, these high-l los correspond to conduction states and therefore using atomic energies
for bound/valence states doesn't have any physical justification.

Prior total energy for trial energy parameter = 1.00

    -3747.45073647    Ha

Changing the parameters from 1.00 to 0.15

    -3747.45073647   Ha

So the basis had no effect on the ground state total energy
