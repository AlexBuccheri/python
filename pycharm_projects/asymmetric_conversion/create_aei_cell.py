""" In order to apply substitutions to the system, one needs a system where all atoms are connected.
    As such, I'm translating all loose atoms into positions in other unit cells BUT are connected as
    nearest neighbours to atoms in the central cell. One can then perform substitutions on this system
    and fold any positions that lie outside the central cell of the final structure, back inside

# Modify rings by doing one B-O-B
#Â Structurally relax the lattice maintaining bond angles
# OR
# Replace around the entirety of each ring before relaxing

# Once one has the supercell, could also randomly apply the snip (whilst retaining global structural connectivity)
